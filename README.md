The Healthcare Professional Profile provides a standard XML format for profile data on healthcare professionals, making it easier to exchange and compile profile data across organizations. This in turn allows for faster credentialing of professionals and faster availability of accurate data to the public. Standardizing the format of professional profile data has many benefits:

* Faster and more accurate updating of credentials data.
* Faster delivery of credentials data to regulatory bodies, healthcare institutions, and the public.
* Easier compilation and integration of data from primary sources.
* Faster development of information systems for credentials data.

Because data is accurate and easy to exchange, it’s easier for regulatory bodies and health care institutions to catch fraudulent practitioners and recognize those claiming the highest levels of qualifications.
